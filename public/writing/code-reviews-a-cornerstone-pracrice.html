  <h1>Code Reviews: a Cornerstone Practice</h1>
  <p>
    <time datetime="2016-10-08">8th October 2016</time>

  <p>
    Since moving to Copenhagen earlier this year I've been working for a (large and successful) digital agency. I was shocked to find they didn't do code reviews. I truly (naively) believed that in 2016 every development team had some form of code review process.
  </p>

  <p>
    It didn't seem like a concious decision either, some of the answers to my questions on the lack of reviews were telling:  
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    The developers on this team are <em>professionals</em>, they don't need their work to be checked
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    We do code reviews, but only for junior developers during their first 2 weeks
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    We each have our own areas of the project code, we know our areas best, so code reviews don't make sense for us
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Agency Time-Centric Culture</h2>
  <p>
    Having worked in a SaaS startup for 4 years prior, the heavy burden of time tracking in agencies came as a surprise. Having to track time to some degree is understandable, since agencies sell time to their clients. And I think some SaaS companies could be more aware of time. But I suspect agency time-centric culture makes it difficult for practices like code reviews to survive.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you have to log every hour of your day to a client invoice, it's hard to justify spending an hour helping another "consultant" make their code more robust. Project managers love developers who burn through their work fast and have time to spare. Unfortunately they don't have much visibility of the underlying <em>quality</em> of the solutions being built, or the long term effects of poor solutions on a project. I think this should change.
  </p>

  <h2>Code Reviews can be a Cornerstone of a Great Team</h2>
  <p>
    There are so many benefits to a good code review process that I say they are a cornerstone practice for great teams. I'm not going to prescribe a process, but in my experience it should be one the whole team agrees on, and one which <strong>requires everybody to put their code through a review</strong> before it gets deployed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Code reviews improve code quality AND the performance of the team. I'll explain why.
  </p>

  <h2>Code Quality</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Reduce Bugs:</strong> Code reviews help catch bugs early. Bugs are cheaper to fix earlier, so that's great. You will also catch bugs get through your QA process, like subtle memory leaks that slow down your app after it's been running in the browser for an hour.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Quality Incentive:</strong> Knowing that your code will be reviewed by someone on your team gives you some extra incentive to do things right and not cut corners.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Prevent Bad Practice:</strong> Reviews help keep bad practices out of the code. Bad practices spread, developers love to reuse code and techniques. And <a href="https://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/software-entropy">the broken window effect</a> means that developers lose respect for poorly maintained code and start to write poor code in response. Code reviews can also reduce existing code smells by stopping their reuse, and encouraging them to be refactored as part of other work.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Quality increases Speed:</strong> Why care about code quality, especially in an agency where you just need to get something that works out the door? Well, one of the ways teams can move faster is by having well-engineered and well-maintained code, it makes it quicker to refactor to fit in new features, and it reduces bug counts and fix time. So the project could be delivered faster, with less bugs, and be in great shape for another phase of work.
  </p>

  <h2>Developer Engagement</h2>
  <p>
    To me this is the most important factor. Any company that build software needs good software engineers, code reviews can help to keep your great developers happy, and help to improve the rest of us.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Learning:</strong> When we get comments out of code reviews we're being given new knowlegde, and we're sharing our knowledge with the team through our code. We're helping new developers align with the team, and giving them an opportunity to share fresh skills. Constant learning is a big part of the appeal of being a developer, without it work becomes boring. And <a href="http://randsinrepose.com/archives/bored-people-quit/">bored people quit</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Less Dependency on Individuals:</strong> We're reducing dependency on individuals, exposure to each others' work means it's easier to pick up where others left off.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Cohesion:</strong> There are opportunities for better team cohesion, discussions on code reviews get people helping each other achieve their objectives
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Engagement:</strong> Lastly and <strong>most importantly</strong>, developer engagement is affected by the projects we work on. Good developers care about working on a well-maintained project, having other developers cutting corners and adding poor quality code is only going to make your best developers unhappy. For a software company, having unhappy developers is a gigantic problem.
