    <h2>Sublime Text</h2>
    <p>
      I've been using Sublime Text for the past 4 years and it's still my favourite, the shortcuts and package ecosystem make it my favourite.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are the packages I use:
      <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Git">Git</a></strong> gives you git commands in Sublime, for example, <code>git log</code> on the current file, <code>git blame</code> a few lines to see who has been hacking you pristine code, or just <code>git diff </code>to remember what you deleted before you went to get your third cofee of the morning!</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
